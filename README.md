## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project employs several key React fundamentals, including:

1. **Components** - Building reusable UI components.
2. **Props** - Passing data between components.
3. **State Management** - Managing component-level state.
4. **useEffect** - Handling side effects such as fetching data.
5. **Context API and Local Storage** - For managing and persisting data across sessions.

## Data Handling and Management

The project uses **Context API** for global state management and **Local Storage** for persisting user preferences and cart data. This combination allows for efficient data handling and storage, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Category Filtering**: Users can filter products by categories to quickly find what they're looking for.
2. **Responsive Design**: The site is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
3. **Nested Layouts**: Efficiently structured layouts for Sidebar and Main Segment, making navigation intuitive.
4. **Interactive Error Page**: A custom, visually appealing 404 error page enhances the UX.
5. **Persistent Cart**: Items added to the cart are saved using local storage, allowing users to return to their saved items later.
